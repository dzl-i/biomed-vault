## privacy and safety

---

### australian privacy act

Only data that are relevant to the research are shown and visible to all researchers with an account 

Confidential data such as patient name and date of birth are hidden to the public

Researcher contact information is available for further inquiries

---

### data logging

Every request is logged, showing researcher's name, their action, and the outcome of the request (success or fail)

Only available to system admins

## future plans

---

### report generation and export

Generate detailed reports on datasets, including patient demographics, mutation details, and data summaries

Export reports in PDF or CSV format for easy sharing with collaborators or publication purposes

---

### enhanced visualisation

Show more data visualisation that can help with research

---

### projects

Allows researchers to collaborate on some patients, allowing them to add/edit patients and their data
